# MyReads Project

## Description
The MyReads  allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project uses an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## How it works
1. On main page you have three shelfs, each of them has own name(Carrently reading, want to read, read).
2. Each book has own status that relevant to shelf - this book is.
3. To remove book from one shelf to another you have to change status of the book (clik on green button on this book, and change staus of this book)
4. To remove book at all chose 'None' value in dropdown menu.
5. On the search page you can find books that you interested in (to open **search page** clikc on green button at the bottom right of the **main page** with plus sign)
6. In the input field type interested theme
7. Select book that you interested in and change its status that you want.
